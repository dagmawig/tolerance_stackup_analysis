# tolerance_stackup_analysis

## This python program is used to do one directional monte carlo tolerance stack up analysis of dimensions.Given the dimensions, their tolerances and the direction of each dimension, this program simulates 10,000 variations of each dimension and calculates the sum total/gap for each variation. The variation is generated using gaussian distribution within the given tolerance where the mean is halfway between the upper and lower spec limit of each dimension and the standard deviation is one sixth of the difference between the upper and lower spec limit.

## example excel file is included in the project folder.
